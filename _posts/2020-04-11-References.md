# Why accretion important

## The growth of supermassive black holes

- [King et al. 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...596L..27K/abstract), "Black Holes, Galaxy Formation, and the MBH-Ïƒ Relation"
  - > This result suggests that the central black holes in galaxies gain most of their mass in phases of super-Eddington accretion, which are presumably obscured or at high redshift. Observed super-Eddington quasars are apparently late in growing their black hole masses.

- [Volonteri & Rees. 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...633..624V/abstract), "Rapid Growth of High-Redshift Black Holes"
  - > Motivated by the observations of luminous quasars around redshift z~6 with SMBH masses ~109 Msolar, we assess the possibility of an early phase of stable supercritical quasi-spherical accretion in the BHs hosted by metal-free halos with virial temperature Tvir>104 K.
  - > We find that even a short phase of supercritical accretion eases the requirements set by the z~6 quasars.
